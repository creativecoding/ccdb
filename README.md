ccdb
====

This is a class I commonly use on projects that don't use popular database solutions. It's not permanent or will hold up to heavy use, but it works for small projects. While it may be against other's styles and coding standards, the whole thing is packed into one class. I find the documentation inside of the class to be self-explanatory.
