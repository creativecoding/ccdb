ccdb
====

This is a class I commonly use on projects that don't use popular database solutions. It's not permanent or will hold up to heavy use, but it works for small projects - and works very well for storing data you cannot normally store in a database. While it may be against other's styles and coding standards, the whole thing is packed into one class.
